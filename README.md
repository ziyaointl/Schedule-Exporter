## Berkeley Schedule Exporter

Export your Berkeley class schedule to .ics! (which can be imported to Google Calendar). Should also work with other schools that use collegescheduler.com.

Note: This is not a novel idea and a number of people have done something similar before (e.g. [here](https://github.com/thisiscam/calcentral-schedule-to-ical) and [here](https://github.com/PranayJuneCS/CalScheduler)). However, none of them seem to work as of Jan 17 2019, so I wrote my own.

### Installation

Download the repo as a zip file. Go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, select import, and select the folder extracted from the zip file.

Chrome web store link coming soon.

### Usage

1. Go to CalCentral, My Academics. Select Organize and preview your upcoming semester.

2. Check the courses you want to export. You can select from both Current Schedule and Shopping Cart.

3. Click on the extension icon in the upper right Chrome menu. (You might have to wait a few seconds for the page to fully load before click on the icon). You should get a file named calendar.ics. Then, you can import this ics file to whatever calendar platform you desire. Classes automatically repeat weekly starting from the first day of the current semester!
